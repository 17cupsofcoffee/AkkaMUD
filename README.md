# AkkaMUD
This repository contains the code from the [Building a MUD in F# and Akka.NET](https://www.seventeencups.net/building-a-mud-with-f-sharp-and-akka-net-part-one/) tutorial series.

I'm sharing this code under the MIT license - please feel free to use it as a starting point for your
own game! All I ask is that you credit me for my contributions, and that you send me a link when it's done
so I can check it out :)

The master branch contains the version of the code I'm currently working on - to view the code as it
was at a certain point in the tutorial, please use these commit tags:
